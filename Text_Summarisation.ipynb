    "## Text-Summarization\n",
    "**Automatic summarization** is the process of shortening a text document with software, in order to create a summary with the major points of the original document. Technologies that can make a coherent summary take into account variables such as length, writing style and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic data summarization is part of the real machine learning and data mining. The main idea of summarization is to find a subset of data which contains the \"information\" of the entire set. Such techniques are widely used in industry today. Search engines are an example; others include summarization of documents, image collections and videos. Document summarization tries to create a representative summary or abstract of the entire document, by finding the most informative sentences, while in image summarization the system finds the most representative and important (i.e. salient) images. For surveillance videos, one might want to extract the important events from the uneventful context.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general approaches to automatic summarization: Extraction and Abstraction. \n",
    "1. *Extractive Summarization*: These methods rely on extracting several parts, such as phrases and sentences, from a piece of text and stack them together to create a summary. Therefore, identifying the right sentences for summarization is of utmost importance in an extractive method.\n",
    "2. *Abstractive Summarization*: These methods use advanced NLP techniques to generate an entirely new summary. Some parts of this summary may not even appear in the original text. Such a summary might include verbal innovations. \n",
    "Research to date has focused primarily on extractive methods, which are appropriate for image collection summarization and video summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, TextRank algorithm for extractive text summarization is implemented using Google's PageRank search algorithm to generate corelations among sentences.\n",

      "Acnesol Gel is an antibiotic that fights bacteria. It is used to treat acne, which appears as spots or pimples on your face, chest or back. This medicine works by attacking the bacteria that cause these pimples.Acnesol Gel is only meant for external use and should be used as advised by your doctor. You should normally wash and dry the affected area before applying a thin layer of the medicine. It should not be applied to broken or damaged skin. Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get it in these areas. It may take several weeks for your symptoms to improve, but you should keep using this medicine regularly. Do not stop using it as soon as your acne starts to get better. Ask your doctor when you should stop treatment.Common side effects like minor itching, burning, or redness of the skin and oily skin may be seen in some people. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. Consult your doctor if they bother you or do not go away.It is a safe medicine, but you should inform your doctor if you have any problems with your bowels (intestines). Also, inform the doctor if you have ever had bloody diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics or if you are using any other medicines to treat skin conditions. Consult your doctor about using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n"
